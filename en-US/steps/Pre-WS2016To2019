<!-- Pre-Upgrade -->

<hr />

### Upgrade path:
Windows Server 2016 can be upgraded to Windows 2019 in a single upgrade process.

### Support:
In-place Upgrade is supported for Windows Server 2016 on physicaL hardware, and in Virtual Machines. Public and private cloud companies also support In-place upgrade on Windows Server 2016 Virtual Machines to upgrade to Windows Server 2019 – check with your cloud provider.

### Alternative:
Migrate (re-deploy) applications and data on a clean install of Windows Server 2019.

### Limitations:
- If you are using Windows Server 2016 Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) clusters (also known as Software Defined Data Center [SDDC] and Hyper-Converged Infrastructure [HCI]) you should contract Microsoft for guidance before upgrading these clusters.

- Windows Servers configured to “Boot from VHD” cannot be upgraded using In-place Upgrade.

## Planning for In-place Upgrade

<hr />

Before proceeding with In-place Upgrade, collect the following information:

- Is there a target or goal timeframe for upgrading this server?

- Is this a production-critical server?

- Is there a maintenance window for upgrading this server?

- Who uses this server? Internal users, external users, or both? Have they been informed of the upgrade or maintenance?

- Is there an inventory of what is running on the server? Check the following:

    - Windows Server **Roles and Features**

    - **Microsoft applications:** SQL Server, SharePoint Server, Exchange Server, etc.

    - **3rd-Party applications:** SAP, Oracle, DB2, etc.

    - Is the server joined to an **Active Directory domain**?

    - Are any of the server disks **BitLocker** protected?

    - Is the server part of a **Failover Cluster**? 

        > Note that Cluster OS Rolling Upgrade can be used to upgrade Windows Server 2016 Failover Clusters to Windows Server 2019.

- How often is the server backed-up? Have backups ever been successfully restored (applied) to the server or applications?

- What backup software is used?

- If In-place Upgrade is not successful and the server needs to be rebuilt, are the Windows Server and application install media available? 

     > Although it is rare, In-place Upgrade can fail and there should be a plan in-place for this possibility, to minimize server downtime and maintain SLAs.

- Is the server fully patched? It is strongly recommended that the server is fully patched prior to In-place Upgrade.

- Run **systeminfo.exe** and save the output:

- Run **ipconfig /all** and save the output:

- Run **Get-WindowsFeature** and save the output:

- Run **RegEdit** and capture the value of the the
    **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsNT\\CurrentVersion** hive
    – this will show the exact version (**BuildLabEx**) and edition
    (**EditionID**) of Windows Server:

## Before proceeding with the In-place Upgrade

<hr />

1.  Backup the Operating System, Applications, and Virtual Machines.

2.  Shutdown, Quick Migrate, or Live Migrate all Virtual Machines running on the server - Virtual Machines **cannot** be running on the server during In-place Upgrade.
