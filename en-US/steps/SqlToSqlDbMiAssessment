<!-- Assess -->

When the data sources have been identified, the next step is to assess any on-premises SQL Server instance(s) that is migrating to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance to understand any gaps between the source and target instances.

**Note**: Data Migration Assistant (DMA) support for migrations to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance is planned for availability during the summer of 2018.
