Migrating an on-premises PostgreSQL instance or a PostgreSQL instance hosted in a virtual machine to Azure Database for PostgreSQL is considered a homogeneous migration. Microsoft aims to support the currently released major version (n) and the two prior major versions (-2), or n-2. Azure Database for PostgreSQL supports versions 9.5.7 and 9.6.2, and if your on-premises PostgreSQL instance is running one of these versions, the database will be fully compatible, and the migration will be relatively straightforward.

If you use extensions in PostgreSQL, please see the article [PostgreSQL extensions in Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/concepts-extensions).
