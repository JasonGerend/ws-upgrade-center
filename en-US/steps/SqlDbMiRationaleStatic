## Rationale for migrating

Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (preview) is a new capability of Azure SQL Database, providing near 100% compatibility with SQL Server on-premises (Enterprise Edition), providing a native virtual network (VNet) implementation that addresses common security concerns, and a business model favorable for on-premises SQL Server customers. Managed Instance allows existing SQL Server customers to lift and shift their on-premises applications to the cloud with minimal application and database changes. At the same time, Managed Instance preserves all PaaS capabilities (automatic patching and version updates, backup, high-availability), that drastically reduces management overhead and TCO.

There are several benefits associated with migrating your database to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.

### PaaS benefits

* No hardware purchasing and management
* No management overhead for managing underlying infrastructure
* Quick provisioning and service scaling
* Automated patching and version upgrade
* Integration with other PaaS data services

### Business continuity

* 99.99% uptime SLA
* Built in high availability
* Data protected with automated backups
* Customer configurable backup retention period (fixed to 7 days in Public Preview)
* User-initiated backups
* Point in time database restore capability

### Security and compliance

* Isolated environment (VNet integration, single-tenant service, dedicated compute and storage)
* Encryption of the data in transit
* Azure AD authentication, single sign-on support
* Adheres to compliance standards same as Azure SQL Database
* SQL auditing
* Threat detection

### Management

* Azure Resource Manager API for automating service provisioning and scaling
* Azure portal functionality for manual service provisioning and scaling
* Azyre Database Migration Service
