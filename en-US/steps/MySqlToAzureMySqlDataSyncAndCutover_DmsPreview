<!--Data sync and Cutover-->

With minimal-downtime migrations, the source you are migrating continues to change, drifting from the target in terms of data and schema, after the one-time migration occurs. During the **Data sync** phase, you need to ensure that all changes in the source are captured and applied to the target in near real time. After you verify that all changes in source have been applied to the target, you can cutover from the source to the target environment.

The Azure Database Migration Service does not yet support minimal-downtime migrations for this scenario, so the **Data sync** and **Cutover** phases are not currently applicable.

**Note**: If you are interested in participating in a Private preview of minimal-downtime functionality for MySQL to Azure Database for MySQL migrations, submit a nomination on teh Azure Database Migration Service [preview page](https://aka.ms/dms-preview).
