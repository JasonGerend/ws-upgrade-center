<!--Migration overview-->

After you have the necessary prerequisites in place and have completed the tasks asociated with the **Pre-migration** phase, you are ready to perform the actual migration.

There are several methods for migrating a SQL Server database to an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (Azure VMs).

### Overview of migration methods

The list below identifies the primary methods for migrating from SQL Server to SQL Server on Azure VMs.
* Use the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to migrate the schema and data into an Azure VM.
* Perform an on-premises backup using compression, and then manually copy the backup file into an Azure VM.
* Perform a backup to URL, and then restore into an Azure VM from the URL.
* Detach and copy the data and log files to Azure Blob storage, and then attach to an Azure VM from the URL.
* Convert an on-premises VW to Hyper-V VHDs, upload to Azure Blob storage, and then deploy a new Azure VM using the uploaded VHD.
* Ship a hard drive using Windows Import/Export Service.
* Use the Add Azure Replica Wizard.
* Use SQL Server transactional replication.

A couple of key points to consider when reviewing the migration methods to determine the best option for your business scenario:
* For optimum data transfer performance, migrate database files into the SQL Server on Azure VM instance using a compressed backup file.
* To minimize downtime during the database migration process, use either the AlwaysOn option or the transactional replication option.

**Tip**: There is no supported way to upgrade the version/edition of an existing SQL Server on Azure VM instance. Instead, create a new SQL Server on Azure VM instance running the desired version/edition, and then use one of the techniques in the table above to move your databases.

If it is not possible to use the above methods, migrate your database manually. Using this method, you will generally start with a database backup followed by a copy of the database backup into Azure and then perform a database restore. You can also copy the database files themselves into Azure and then attach them.

**Note**: When upgrading from older versions of SQL Server to SQL Server 2014 or SQL Server 2016, we recommend that you address all dependencies on features that are not supported by the later version of SQL Server as part of the migration project. For more information on the supported editions and scenarios, see the article [Upgrade SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb677622.aspx).

The following section provides details about using DMA to migrate the schema and data to an Azure VM.
