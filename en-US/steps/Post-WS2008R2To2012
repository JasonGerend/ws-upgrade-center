1. After Setup has completed installing and rebooted the sever, login to check that the server has been successfully upgraded. If you selected Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter Desktop Edition, you should see the Server Manager window:

2. Run **RegEdit** and check the value of the
    **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsNT\\CurrentVersion** hive â€“ the version should be successfully updated to Windows Server 2012.

3. Check that applications are running and that client connections to the applications succeed.

4. If you believe that there has been an issue upgrading you server, you should copy and Zip the **%SystemRoot%\\Panther** (usually **C:\\Windows\\Panther**) directory and contact support.
