## Migration process overview

Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project â€“ a solid methodology is required for success. When planning a database migration project, we recommend that you consider the process shown in the following graphic: ![SQL Migration Process](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/MigrationProcess_New.png) Each phase in the database migration process is briefly described in the following table:

<table id='overview' class='overview'>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="x-hidden-focus"><strong>Stage</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Phase</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="3" class="premigration">Pre-migration</td>
      <td>Discover</td>
      <td>Inventory database assets, and application stack discovery.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Assess</td>
      <td>Assess workloads and fix recommendations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Convert<span class="highlight">*</span></td>
      <td>For heterogeneous migrations, convert the source schema to work in the target environment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="3" class="migration">Migration</td>
      <td>Migrate schema, data, and objects</td>
      <td>Migrate the source schema, and then migrate the source data to the target.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="x-hidden-focus">Sync data<span class="highlight">*</span></td>
      <td>For minimal downtime migrations, sync your target schema and data with the source.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cutover<span class="highlight">*</span></td>
      <td>For minimal downtime migrations, cut over from the source to the target environment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="3" class="postmigration">Post-migration</td>
      <td>Remediate applications</td>
      <td>Iteratively make any necessary changes to your applications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Perform Tests</td>
      <td>Iteratively run functional and performance tests.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Optimize</td>
      <td>Based on the tests you performed, address any performance issues, and then retest to confirm the performance improvements.</td>
    </tr>
     </tbody>
