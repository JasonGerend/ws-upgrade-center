## Rationale for migrating

Azure Cosmos DB was built from the ground up with global distribution and horizontal scale at its core. It offers turnkey global distribution across any number of Azure regions by transparently scaling and replicating your data wherever your users are. Elastically scale throughput and storage worldwide, and pay only for what you need. Azure Cosmos DB provides native support for NoSQL choices, offers multiple well-defined consistency models, guarantees single-digit-millisecond latencies at the 99th percentile, and guarantees high availability with multi-homing capabilities and low latencies anywhere in the world— all backed by industry-leading, comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs).

When evaluating your rationale for migrating, consider the detail provided in the following sections.

**Turnkey global distribution**
 - Easily build globally-distributed applications without the hassle of complex, multiple-datacenter configurations. Designed as a [globally distributed database system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally), Azure Cosmos DB automatically replicates your data to any number of regions of your choice, for fast, responsive access. Azure Cosmos DB supports transparent multi-homing and guarantees 99.999% high availability.

**Multi-model + multi-API START**
 - Only Azure Cosmos DB allows you to use key-value, graph, column-family, and document data in one service. Azure Cosmos DB automatically indexes all data, and allows you to use your favorite API including [SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/documentdb-sql-query), [JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/programming), [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html), [MongoDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-introduction), [Apache® Cassandra](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/cassandra-introduction), and [Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/) to access your data.

**Limitless elastic scale around the globe**
 - With Azure Cosmos DB, you only pay for the throughput and storage you need. Azure Cosmos DB allows you to independently and [elastically scale storage and throughput](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data) at any time, anywhere across the globe, making it a perfect ally for your [serverless applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/serverless-computing/).

**Multiple, well-defined consistency choices**
 - Azure Cosmos DB offers five well-defined consistency levels—strong, bounded staleness, consistent-prefix, session, and eventual—for an intuitive programming model with low latency and high availability for your planet-scale app.

**Guaranteed low latency at 99th percentile**
 - Serve read and write requests from the nearest region while simultaneously distributing data across the globe. With its latch-free and write optimized database engine, Azure Cosmos DB guarantees less than 10-ms latencies on reads and less than 15-ms latencies on (indexed) writes at the 99th percentile.

**Industry-leading, enterprise-grade SLAs**
Rest assured your apps are running on a “battle-tested” database service, built on world-class infrastructure. Azure Cosmos DB gives you enterprise-grade security and compliance, and is the first and only service to offer [industry-leading comprehensive SLAs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/cosmos-db/) for 99.999% high availability, latency at the 99th percentile, guaranteed throughput, and consistency.
