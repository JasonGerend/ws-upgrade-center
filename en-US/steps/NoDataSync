<!--Data sync-->

For minimal-downtime migrations, the source you are migrating continues to change after the one-time migration occurs, and it will drift from the target in terms of data and schema. During this phase, you need to ensure that all changes from source are captured and applied to the target in near real time. Support for minimal-downtime migrations is not yet available for this scenario, so the Data sync phase is currently unnecessary.
