## Upgrade paths overview

When you upgrade a Windows Server,you move from an existing operating system release to a more recent release while staying on the same hardware. (This is sometimes called "in-place" upgrade.) For example, if your server is running Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2, you can upgrade it to Windows Server 2016. You can upgrade from an evaluation version of the operating system to a retail version, from an older retail version to a newer version, or, in some cases, from a volume-licensed edition of the operating system to an ordinary retail edition.

Windows Server can be upgraded in-place at least one, and sometimes two versions forward. For example, Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 can be upgraded in-place to Windows Server 2019. The following graphic shows the upgrade paths for Windows Server. Downward pointing arrows represent the multiple upgrades that must be performed on older vesrions to bring them up to Windows Server 2019:
